        <p>
            This is my personal blog site. 
            I will summarize my understanding of the graphics rendering pipeline in this blog.
            <br>
            The rendering pipeline is the foundation of graphics, and almost everyone who studies rendering needs to master this process.
            Although I have studied and reviewed the rendering pipeline process many times, I have never sorted it out and summarized it. 
            Taking advantage of this course assignment, I want to write a blog and make it a website.
